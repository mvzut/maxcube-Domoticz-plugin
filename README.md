# maxcube-Domoticz-plugin
First attempt for creating a Python plugin for Domoticz, integrating the eQ-3 MAX! system.

Leaning heavily on the work of hackercowboy: https://github.com/hackercowboy/python-maxcube-api
Compliments hackercowboy for a very easy to use Python Cube API!

It's still super beta, let me know what you think and if you encounter issues.
